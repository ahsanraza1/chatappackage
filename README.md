Absolutely! Here's a **fully clean and ready-to-paste `README.md` file content** for your `ahsanraza1/builtinchat` Laravel package:

---

### ✅ Final README.md Content (Copy & Paste Below)

````markdown
# BuiltinChat

A Livewire-based real-time chat package for Laravel apps.

---

## 📦 Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require ahsanraza1/builtinchat:@dev
````

> Make sure your Laravel version is 8+ and PHP version is 8.0 or higher.

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### 1. Route Setup

Add the following route in your `routes/web.php` file:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use ahsanraza1\builtinchat\Livewire\Messenger;

Route::middleware(['auth', 'web'])
    ->prefix('builtinchat')
    ->name('builtinchat.')
    ->group(function () {
        Route::get('/', Messenger::class)->name('messenger');
    });
```

Now you can visit `/builtinchat` (while logged in) to access the chat.

---

### 2. Authentication Required

This package assumes you already have authentication set up. The route is protected by `auth` middleware, so only logged-in users can use the chat.

---

### 3. Blade Integration (Optional)

If you want to include the chat in your Blade views, you can use the Livewire component directly:

```blade
@livewire('ahsanraza1\builtinchat\livewire\messenger')
```

Or, if you register the component manually:

```php
Livewire::component('builtinchat-messenger', \ahsanraza1\builtinchat\Livewire\Messenger::class);
```

Then you can use:

```blade
@livewire('builtinchat-messenger')
```

---

### 4. Publishing Assets (If Needed)

If the package contains views, config, or assets you want to modify, you can publish them using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Ahsanraza1\Builtinchat\BuiltInChatServiceProvider"
```

---

## 🔧 Laravel Package Discovery

Laravel automatically discovers the service provider. If you need to manually add it, update `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Ahsanraza1\Builtinchat\BuiltInChatServiceProvider::class,
],
```
